My Name is Daniel Normandia. I was born in Brooklyn, NY, and moved to Marlboro, NJ when I was 9. I was raised by 2 devout Catholic parents. My father was a special ed and delinquent school teacher in the NY Schools system. Taught me to use computers from a young age, which has assisted me ever since in learning new computer related skills.
